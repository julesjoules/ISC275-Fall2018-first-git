1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
    1 ArrayList of type Dog called "dogs" (declared with "new" ArrayList<DOG>)
    3 dogs: Fido, Fido, and Alfie (declared with "new" Dog)
    1 Comparator of type Animal (declared with "new" Comparator<Animal>)  
3. Can you spot the comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the comparator?
    it is constructed with the word "new" on line 16 {new Comparator<Animal>();}
    The class definition is between the{} after new Comparator() aka lines 17-20
